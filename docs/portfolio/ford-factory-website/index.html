            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Located on the south end of the Downtown L.A. Arts District, the <a href="http://shorenstein.com/portfolio/investments/property?id=6833" target="_blank">Ford Factory</a> is a four-building 257,000 square foot brick industrial compound with heavy-duty mushroom cap columns and a rooftop water tower. From 1913 &mdash; 1929, it served as the original manufacturing assembly plant of Ford&rsquo;s Model T and Model A vehicles for the Western United States.</p>
                <p>Rich in history, the building was later occupied by U.S. Rubber, Lockheed Aircraft, Bullocks, and the Imperial Toy Company to name a few. Restoration of the building into creative office space was thoughtfully designed by <a href="http://rockefellerpartners.com" target="_blank">Rockefeller Partners Architects</a> in El Segundo, and our team was brought on to help market the opportunity.</p>

            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>After a major tenant backed-out, the building went from empty to <a href="http://labusinessjournal.com/news/2016/oct/07/warner-music-group-inks-ford-factory-lease/" target="_blank">full single tenant lease = the dream</a>.</p>

              <div class="expander-content">
                <h4>Design Inspiration</h4>
                <p>Starting with a creative brief, three rough renderings, and a new identity to the project&rsquo;s name, the design process started with developing a visual language as unique as the building. For example, a color palette was built from Ford&rsquo;s Classic Shelby Mustang, <a href="http://www.shelbyamerican.com" target="_blank">Shelby</a> itself a Ford performance variant also built in Los Angeles in the 1960&rsquo;s.</p>

                <figcaption>Color study inspired by various historical Ford palettes</figcaption>
                <p class="topsies">While clarity was stressed, visual details were treated with nostalgia, care was given down to type choice. Old Model T car manuals were studied and typography was built around characters that were relevant during the factory&rsquo;s operation.</p>

                <figcaption>Image from the website showing just how dense and heavy this building was, 300lbs./sq. ft. is a tank.</figcaption>
                <h4>Interviews &amp; Insights</h4>
                <p>Observations from the architect were incorporated into the website and eventual marketing book. This is a building that is super heavy, just look at all of the sand bags above. The architects in their design, created a dramatically open and light space, so we conceptually played with the contrast of light and heavy…whitespace with very hueful imagery of Downtown Los Angeles.</p>
                <p>In conducting interviews with the client, a big misnomer in the commercial real estate was the definition of the Arts District. For a broker in New York, what was the Downtown L.A. Arts District? What was happening to the region? How would a tenant make use of working there, and what were current conditions like?</p>

              <div class="expander-content">
                <p>Initially launched in 2015, the website continually housed content updates to amenities and renderings. Outside of content, the design remained stable through full lease the following year. It is amazing how many restaurants and boutique shops opened in the area during the window of a year. The design remained stable throughout the campaign, and led to the eventual design and publishing of a nice marketing book.</p>
                <p>You can see images of that book on Looking&rsquo;s website <a href="http://looking.la/app/assets/imgs/ford/ff-brochure-emboss.jpg" target="_blank" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://looking.la/app/assets/imgs/ford/ff-brochure-location.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://looking.la/app/assets/imgs/ford/ff-brochure-color.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://looking.la/app/assets/imgs/ford/ff-brochure-features.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://looking.la/app/assets/imgs/ford/ff-brochure-features.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://looking.la/app/assets/imgs/ford/ff-brochure-spread.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://looking.la/app/assets/imgs/ford/ff-brochure-transportation-map.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="http://looking.la/app/assets/imgs/ford/ff-brochure-envelope.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <p>In October of 2016, Warner Music Group signed a multi-year lease effectively completing marketing efforts. Congrats to <a href="http://shorenstein.com" target="_blank">Shorenstein</a>, <a href="http://www.cbre.com" target="_blank">CBRE</a>, as well as the Downtown L.A. Arts District which is well deserving of a big name in town. If you are in the area, I highly recommend one of my favorite chocolatiers <a href="https://mastbrothers.com" target="_blank">Mast Brothers</a>. The goat and sheep milk chocolates are simple yet slightly transcendental. Of course, if you are a fan of this project, then definitely try their smoke chocolate, an apt flavor.</p>
