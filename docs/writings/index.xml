&lt;h3 id=&#34;aka-portfoliobuild-using-hugo-gulp-bourbon-github-pages&#34;&gt;aka #portfolioBuild - Using Hugo + Gulp + Bourbon + GitHub Pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/Rm1p7xp3Odl2o/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;bit by bit&#34; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Finally, my very own site, built in a way I want…haha, haha, gif from &lt;a href=&#34;https://giphy.com/gifs/Rm1p7xp3Odl2o&#34;&gt;Clasharama&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building your own project/portfolio site is kin to building your own custom bike or custom brewing rig, the options are exhausting and the reasoning behind execution is important. Being able to know why you made a decision is part of the reward of creating your own website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I will go into how I put together this very site, and more importantly why I chose to do things a certain way. This post is for dev and design nerds, but may pave a way for those looking to build a portfolio site for themselves. There are infinite decision points and quite a lot of steps, but this post will give you a specific perspective. I will dive into some technical details in a later post for those who want to see bits of build in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;#summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design using ux and product process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implement gulp for build workflow and to process custom scss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use hugo to process markdown files to streamline writings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build with neat grid-system to learn new front-end framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;host for free on github pages to manage deployment and versioning simultaneously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invest in custom webfonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;introduce folding of the dom and typed text to emphasize site identity and summary on the homepage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;custom&#34;&gt;#custom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single most important attribute to me was that this site was designed and built by hand. I would permit the use of front-end frameworks, but seeing that I am selling myself as a product designer/manager within web, I want to show that I am not afraid to handmake my own portfolio site. I also want to support the industry of front-end development, so no Squarespace or Wix here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;whiteboard-to-sketchapp&#34;&gt;#whiteboard to #sketchapp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, I started wireframing on a poster-size whiteboard at home. Lots of erasing took place to find out what combination of content would suffice to share both my design sensibilities and thought process. Tell me if this sounds like a good combination for an MVP portfolio site…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to showcase work in a visual and written context. #check&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A page dedicated to introduce myself. #check #hubris&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A blog for sustaining ongoing efforts. #check (no product is complete afterall, including my humble site!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wireframes were presented to a select few, and I refined in &lt;a href=&#34;https://sketchapp.com&#34;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt; before finalizing the design. Attention was paid to a responsive grid system, use of lightweight svg&amp;rsquo;s when possible, and a type system that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stretch my writings into impossibly long lines to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;blog-platform-independence&#34;&gt;#blog platform independence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written a blog before. I&amp;rsquo;ve used &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tumblr.com&#34;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, Vox (the blogging platform that closed in 2013), &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.livejournal.com&#34;&gt;Livejournal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://scriptogr.am&#34;&gt;Scriptogram&lt;/a&gt; (which also closed down, later in 2015). Blogs require effort, and to rely on a system that could be shut down doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem sustainable in the long run. Tumblr was purchased by Yahoo!, Livejournal by a Russian Media Company. Vox and Scriptogram had their plugs completely pulled out of the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordpress and Jekyll are great, however they are heavy duty. I want to update posts right where I feel at home in a text editor. Wordpress has some performance concerns both in security and that it is a big bloated system for my needs. Jekyll is almost perfect, however it relies on Ruby gems, so a system to install a system. I wanted something minimalist, that did not rely on updating WYSIWYG content windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;#markdown&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, keeping up a blog requires effort, so the last thing I wanted to be faced with was having to update security patches before I started writing, or resetting my admin password before copy/pasting a story to publish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write in a text editor most of the time, so it seemed natural to me to write in a text editor (of which I am a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sublimetext.com&#34;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt;), not in a content management textbox. Speed is of the essence when writing, and readability is the greatest accomplishment I could acheive in function, so I decided to write all blog posts in &lt;a href=&#34;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. Markdown is embraced both for its simplicity and speed. Posts will now take a fraction to write, as I can focus on plain text syntax, and not be bogged down with mark-up language (Funny, I just got why it is called Markdown).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hugo&#34;&gt;#hugo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was searching for a website engine then that would allow me to build content right in Markdown, and I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. Hugo has the perks of many website engines out there that can render Markdown, but it excels are processing speed and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was comparing Hugo to Jekyll, and with Jekyll, you have to organize files a certain way, there are rubygem dependencies, and for my concerns, I would have to either learn how to build or modify a theme template. This is working backwards for me. I wanted to be able to build a unique web design, and then plug in a website engine to update content, not modify a theme to my design, or design around an existing theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last perk is that Hugo is fast, it can rip a static build of the site in a fraction of the time it takes using other static site generators. I am considering studying Hugo further to help design and develop themes to share for others. It is a fun process. Super secure, there is no database or external libraries to hack. I am a huge fan now, and would consider it for future custom projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;automation-amp-frameworks&#34;&gt;#automation &amp;amp; #frameworks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every developer gets to pick their tools for the build, and having spent the last three years working with a dev team, I focused on implementing both &lt;a href=&#34;http://gulpjs.com&#34;&gt;Gulp.js&lt;/a&gt; for task automation, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://neat.bourbon.io&#34;&gt;Neat&lt;/a&gt; as a front-end framework. Below is a bit of thought on both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;neat-bourbon-bitters-refills&#34;&gt;#neat, bourbon, bitters, refills&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using and tweaking &lt;a href=&#34;http://getbootstrap.com&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; for the past four years. Related to a conversation I had with a colleague at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.productschool.com&#34;&gt;Product School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/swtcourt&#34;&gt;Courtney&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to use Bourbon as a new framework to learn on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to rely on Bourbon lightly for a Sass mixin library and concentrate on a custom Scss library I&amp;rsquo;ve written over the years. Bourbon itself is a few years old and extremely smaller in file size compared to Bootstrap. Creators &lt;a href=&#34;https://thoughtbot.com&#34;&gt;thoughtbot&lt;/a&gt; gets major credit for their approach to accessibility with the project. One minor downside is that a lot of Bourbon&amp;rsquo;s mixins have been deprecated, so the library is rather small. I used what made sense and instead focused on Neat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neat is a Sass grid, which would allow me to play with margins and columns without hacking the framework to pieces. I could embed, collapse, and shift columns just like in Bootstrap, but with a fraction of the code. Learned new framework, win win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gulp&#34;&gt;#gulp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think a front-end framework is a bit of an academic decision, using Gulp was imperative. It&amp;rsquo;s workflow could automate the following with one command line in Terminal (I&amp;rsquo;m listing what is in my actual gulpfile):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take all of the custom styles I write in scss and process them into CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concatenate all of the CSS libraries into a single CSS file and minimize that file, including files from Bourbon and Neat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map which original scss files are responsible for each element for troubleshooting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refreshes the browser everytime a CSS, HTML, or JS file is saved (huge time saver).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concatenate all of the JS libraries into a single JS file and minimize that file, including external JS libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy all minimized files to a specific destination folder for deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy over static files like font files into a specific destination folder for deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purge the specific destination folder each time before files are saved to eliminate redundancies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize image asset files and save into a specific destination directory for deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect all new minimized asset files to their relative paths, essentially creating a deployment version of the site without any preprocess file redundancies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It rules! I relied heavily over the last two years for our dev team to set this up, so it was refreshing to set up Gulp for myself. I highly recommend it for its sass pre-processor and browser-sync functions alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cost&#34;&gt;#cost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was important to me that the overhead for this site be as manageable as possible. There is no business incentive to pay a lot to share information on my site. There is also no eCommerce component to the site, so no direct return to time investment. Sound relatable? Here are some decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;github-pages-amp-hover-com&#34;&gt;#GitHub Pages &amp;amp; #Hover.com&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a back-end developer, so knowing there is no need to flex muscles building a custom back-end, I decided to host my site on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. I already use GitHub as part of my versioning process, and GitHub pages has evolved to make it very easy to publish a project or personal site for free. Downsides include the elimination of any ability to use server-side scripting languages, but this is far outweighed by my ability to push straight from repository to live site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hover.com&#34;&gt;Hover&lt;/a&gt; for registering domain names. Their ethical compass far exceeds major competitors, and they have a decent library of TLD&amp;rsquo;s to choose from. Danno.cc breaks down into &amp;ldquo;Danno&amp;rdquo; (my full name condensed) and &amp;ldquo;cc&amp;rdquo; of which right now stands for &amp;ldquo;Cycling Club&amp;rdquo; (hat tip to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/&#34;&gt;Rapha&lt;/a&gt; for the idea) as I am currently training for my first century ride. Side note, I polled my friends about which URL suffix to use, and &amp;ldquo;.cc&amp;rdquo; was the overwhelming winner. Other domain suffices such as &amp;ldquo;.design&amp;rdquo; are too literal, and &amp;ldquo;.co&amp;rdquo; is a few years overplayed and technically is the TLD for Columbia. Domains through hover.com are typically $10-30/yr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;colophon-foundry-amp-google-webfonts&#34;&gt;#Colophon Foundry &amp;amp; #Google Webfonts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is for the type nerds out there. While there are major cost savings now with hosting for free, I think it is a worthwhile investment to purchase a webfont license from a proper type foundry. #supportYourFoundry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my own expressions, I am using the medium weight of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.colophon-foundry.org/typefaces/apercu/&#34;&gt;Aperçu Pro&lt;/a&gt; as the header typeface. I was introduced to the typeface by my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elisa-foster.com&#34;&gt;Elisa&lt;/a&gt; last year, and have found that its take on a classic realist sans-serif felt refreshing and accessible to me personally. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the typeface all over &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.typewolf.com&#34;&gt;Typewolf&amp;rsquo;s site&lt;/a&gt;, a testament to its relevance as a pop font.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Display type is important, but body copy is critical. While GitHub pages can send you Aperçu Pro&amp;rsquo;s font files quickly, I decided on using Google&amp;rsquo;s CDN magic to serve you &lt;a href=&#34;https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans&#34;&gt;Work Sans&lt;/a&gt; lightning fast. Work Sans is a grotesque sans serif, which is my personal nod to just how punk rock grotesque type was when it came about. Work Sans is a nerdy grotesque, optimized for screens between 14&amp;em;48px in size, and pairs well with Aperçu Pro. There will be no font-blink-webfont in this build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;flair&#34;&gt;#flair&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added two JS libraries that I want to call out on my homepage, which will please a solid few. I wanted to fold the dom &lt;a href=&#34;http://oridomi.com&#34;&gt;(oridomi)&lt;/a&gt; to conceptually explain where the name &amp;ldquo;danno&amp;rdquo; comes from as an identity. I also wanted to keep summary intro text on a typing animation &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/&#34;&gt;(typed.js)&lt;/a&gt;, not to increase engagement, but because I grew up watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1WnfMFUqWQ&#34;&gt;Doogie Howser, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoy the site as we go from MVP onward. I hope to share design and dev resources in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>why open spaces are important to cities</title>
      <link>http://danno.co/writings/why-open-spaces-are-important/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2017 12:27:27 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As part of a writing series for my favorite ongoing outdoor block party ever, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ciclavia.org/stories&#34;&gt;CicLAvia&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to share some thoughts on why it is that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_open_space&#34;&gt;open spaces&lt;/a&gt; are important for cities from my perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;article class=&#34;post-header-img&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://danno.co/images/wr-h-march-time-march.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;An open space at Legoland&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Bomp-a-domp-bum Bum-a-bum-bum-put&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;legoland2miniland2rl&#34;&gt;#legoland2miniland2RL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent visit to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.legoland.com/california/&#34;&gt;LEGOLAND&lt;/a&gt; for spring break this past week was a blast. Thanks to some free tickets from a friend (thanks friend!), we spent some quality time together at our first amusement park visit as a family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took no more than a crowded park and some afternoon sun for my wife and I to notice that the kids were just a tad irritable. The kids were wonderful in general, but we could tell they needed a change of scenery from long lines, distant tantrums, all the freaking soda everywhere, etc. They were fed, dipes were clean, kids were well-rested, so we were left scratching our heads a little. It happened both days, and the hypothesis we came up with was that both kids were simply a little overstimulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.legoland.com/california/legoland-california/rides-and-attractions/park-areas/miniland-usa/&#34;&gt;Miniland&lt;/a&gt;, an area about 1/12th of the park with built-out miniature city dioramas of Las Vegas, California, New York City, and Washington D.C. at what I found cited as &lt;a href=&#34;http://bricksetforum.com/discussion/23442/calculating-an-accurate-scale-of-lego-figures-miniland-minidoll-minifig-nanofig-etc&#34;&gt;1:20 scale&lt;/a&gt;. There were still many people here, but unlike the rest of the park which was covered in large amusement rides and lego themed buildings, Miniland was an open park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the open, kids were like a wilting plant to water. They calmed way down, or energized up, got very focused studying details and movement, and both kids were mesmerized in what I would call a self-storytelling state. There were other places in the park with lego statues, buildings, and movement, but they were surrounded by buildings or rides. Miniland was the one setion where the lower height of the models meant more open sky, more space, and the kids responded well to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translating this to real life, we could see in a controlled experience that having room to move freely, to explore freely, really changed the mindset for both kids. We visited the section both days to recharge and push on for the afternoon. Fresh off the trip, I have noticed in general how going out into the open helps both kids behaviorally, and I can only extrapolate that this is true for most denizens of a city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;askapro&#34;&gt;#askapro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2876/9542246561_300cd6dd66_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Grand View Park in downtown Los Angeles&#34; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A grand open space with a grand view, Grand View Park in downtown Los Angeles&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In true product fashion, and admitting that I am no urban planner, I wanted to interview some other people for their thoughts and ideas on open space. I asked a landscape designer what her thoughts were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Open spaces in metropolitan cities mean there is light. There is room to observe and feel light on the physical body. Without open spaces, light is controlled out of experience into indoor building. Light is essential.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a cool answer, I sent out email surveys and will post additional answers here. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my own two cents below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my2cents&#34;&gt;#my2cents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8446/7821333012_ae80c94201_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;L.A. Historic Park&#34; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;L.A. State Historic Park circa fall 2012&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer for why open spaces are so important to cities is conservative in nature. Open spaces, specifically parks and plazas in a metropolitan area are important as they represent the only living/organic relics that reflect lifestyle and civilization of the area over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-recent-example&#34;&gt;#a recent example?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch this clip first…
&lt;!-- YouTube Embed --&gt;
&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div class=&#39;embed-container&#39;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/guTzk7h0-XQ?rel=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles State Historic Park just reopened last week, after 65 public hearings and over three years of construction. The clip above was made by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqXj1l54mZYnYMb69lUeRSg&#34;&gt;Thomas Carroll&lt;/a&gt; and shows the park right before it was renovated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renovated? Yes, the renovation itself explains why I think open spaces are so important to cities. Renovated Los Angeles State Historic Park has a pedestrian bridge, an irrigation system for reclaimed water, an orange grove, California Poppies, trees, and you guessed it…open space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 50 years the area may be completely different, but for now it is a playable, enjoyable space that reflects how Los Angelians like and use a public space. It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful living histograph of society. In 100 years maybe the park will be all floating seats with usb dongles and xxl iced coffee cup holders, but that will be then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;keepitopen&#34;&gt;#keepitopen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squares in Paris, green lots in Vancouver, Central Park in NYC, the Pacific Ocean in West L.A., they are all open spaces, and having spent time in each, mind playgrounds for me. I find myself rejuvinated in them, just like my kids at Miniland. Perhaps it is that I think food and drink taste better in big open spaces, maybe it is the people watching (#keepitweird right?), but I think in summary it is the articulation of space that gives us an awareness of space and makes us all feel a little more human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s put everything to sleep and go find a sunny spot and a sarong and go catnap outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hattip&#34;&gt;#hattip&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to enjoy the outdoors more this year. One small group of dedicated outdoor enthusiasts deserve a little hat tip. Go on instagram and search for #ballonacreekcampcoffee or #larivercampcoffee. Book your morning alarm on an upcoming Wednesday, and meet us to drink coffee outside together. It is dope, and something I hope becomes a past time as timeless as the fishermen fishing on the jetty next to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;roll-one-hundred&#34;&gt;#roll-one-hundred&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking to the streets and bike paths lately in great anticipation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.la-bike.org/&#34;&gt;LACBC&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s 17th Annual &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.la-bike.org/riverride&#34;&gt;LA River Ride 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Call it fitness pressure, but I signed up to ride 100 miles come June 4th, up and down the L.A. River out past Long Beach and back. Mind you, this will be my first ever &amp;ldquo;century&amp;rdquo; ride, so I have some prep to do. I&amp;rsquo;m considering this is an addendum to my time transitioning into product - to get fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biking is a great exercise for me. Solid cardio, great core and leg strengthening (ooh la la those legs), and some vitamin D and cool sites and sounds you can&amp;rsquo;t see from walking or driving around L.A. I&amp;rsquo;ve been cycling on and off since I was six, a by-product of growing up in an Indy-car town where tinkering with vehicle and engine is second hand. Sound familiar? #product&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say outright that biking is the most social form of exercise out there, it is surprising how many interactions I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the short 2-3 weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve started riding again. Twenty-minute ride-alongs with strangers who see me struggling and coach me along. Chit chat off bikes at destination points with experienced riders. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/brkfstburrito/?hl=en&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strava.com/athletes/18288126&#34;&gt;Strava&lt;/a&gt; have been strong inspiration and motivation respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cadence-hack&#34;&gt;#cadence hack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss strategy - one big method of training is to run a long time (or distance - same thing essentially) at a high cadence of 90-110 rpm. With this training, the focus is less on forcing your legs to heft, and rely more on ride volume (time in the saddle) and cardio capacity (how hard you can push before you pant out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;m riding for two hours in L.A. with constant distraction and traffic, which means real vigilence is needed to pedal at the right frequency. Here is a quick cadence reference I use, and a small cadence hack…just listen to a few seconds of A Tribe Called Quest&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxKVYUHBdA&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;We the People&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a steady 93 bpm. It&amp;rsquo;s a solid beat, memorable song, and the idea is your left foot should rotate one full crank for each beat, &lt;em&gt;boom&lt;/em&gt;, 93 rpm #nowthatissomequicktoetapping. Here&amp;rsquo;s the song performed last fall on SNL.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-gear-study-my-whips&#34;&gt;#a gear study - my whips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two bikes I&amp;rsquo;ve ridden for a few years, each with totally different purposes, but both are in fine shape to ride and train on. I swap on a dime, one goes out with me on Monday, another on the next riding day, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am riding on two bikes, a steel Surly Cross Check I got on sale to tow my kids about, get myself to work/errand destinations, and, in general, ride for fun around town. It&amp;rsquo;s description is worth another post sometime, but the main point is that it rides on fatter tires smooth like butter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second bike, what I will call a &lt;em&gt;vintage&lt;/em&gt; Lemond* is a tad lighter, with a more aggressive geometry (also worth a separate blog post), and though it is 12 years old, it&amp;rsquo;s been a real pleasure and workhorse for me. I plan on riding it for the century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;*It is only 12 years old, but to me looks vintage next to some whips out there.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;constants&#34;&gt;#constants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the tire circumferences are the same (plus or minus a few millimeters due to the fatter tire), and the crank arm length is the same (distance from the pedal to the center of the bottom bracket), I want to devise a quick reference table to help myself and potentially any rider out there who have bikes with different front cassettes, but are trying to be disciplined with their cadence training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;theproblem&#34;&gt;#theproblem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m fairly new to giving thought to the drive train. Previous riding meant finding a comfortable gear per tarmac pitch, pushing harder on up grades, pushing easier on down grades. Now I&amp;rsquo;m focused on toe tapping to &amp;ldquo;We The People&amp;rdquo;, which means that if gears don&amp;rsquo;t line up, I&amp;rsquo;m training at different power bike to bike. How can I find a gearing set-up that will be similar across both bikes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gearmath-example&#34;&gt;#gearmath example&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Lemond, I have a 53 / 39 front cassette, meaning that I have two rings to choose from - one larger ring with 53 teeth and one smaller ring with 39. This is a standard crankset for many classic road bikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var frontCogLemond = new Array(&amp;quot;39&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;53&amp;quot;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rear cassette is 12&amp;mdash;26, meaning gears ranging from 12 teeth on the small ring to 26 teeth on the large. The rear cassette cog breakdown for reference is…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var rearCogLemond = new Array (&amp;quot;12&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;13&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;14&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;15&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;17&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;19&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;21&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;23&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;26&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to ride two hours on the smaller front ring (baby steps right?), as well as the fifth ring down from the lowest gear in the rear, I&amp;rsquo;m pedaling a ratio of…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;39 teeth / 17 teeth = 2.294&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that my rear wheel is spinning 2.29x for every single rotation of the cranks. At 93 rpm, thats some spinning wheels!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;gear-math-example-2&#34;&gt;Gear Math Example 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Surly, the front and rear cog are more compact, the configuration is similar to a mountain bike even though it is an entry-level cyclocross bike (if these terms are unfamiliar, then &lt;a href=&#34;dan.hanasono@gmail.com&#34;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to go into more detail with you). The Surly is conveniently an 18 speed bike, but the cassettes both have different teeth per cog. The front cassette is 48 / 36, and rear cassette is 11&amp;mdash;32…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var frontCogSurly = new Array(&amp;quot;36&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;48&amp;quot;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var rearCogSurly = new Array (&amp;quot;11&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;12&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;14&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;16&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;18&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;21&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;24&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;28&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;32&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to hop over to the Surly, and set my gears in the exact same position (smaller front gear &amp;amp; fifth gear down from the lowest in the rear), the ratio would feel different, or would it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;36 teeth / 21 teeth = 1.714&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? Well, on the Surly, if I was keeping that same 93 rpm &lt;em&gt;#wethepeople&lt;/em&gt;, then my rear tire would be spinning almost a half rotation less per crank spin. Trying to maintain a similar speed on this smaller gear, I would have to allegro up to 140 rpm which would me my knees would fall off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joke, but the end result if I rigidly stayed in this arrangement would probably be an overall slower speed and more time in the saddle (which can be less fun).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thetables&#34;&gt;#thetables&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a rudimentary table of the gear ratio combos for both bikes, let&amp;rsquo;s see if we see any patterns. I&amp;rsquo;ve matched up similar ratios independent of rear cassette size…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;39 Front Gear&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;12-26 Rear Gear&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Ratio A&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;36 Front Gear&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;11-32 Rear Gear&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Ratio B&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-.&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-.&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.70&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.71&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.86&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-.&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.05&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.60&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.57&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.79&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-.&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
…and on the bigger front cassette…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;54 Front Gear&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;12-26 Rear Gear&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Ratio A&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;48 Front Gear&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;11-32 Rear Gear&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Ratio B&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-.&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-.&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.71&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.08&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.35&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.57&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.67&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.84&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-.&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-.&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-.&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.60&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.43&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.86&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-.&amp;ndash;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to line up values to the nearest ~ +/- 15 hundredths of a gear ratio. I figure that my legs probably could not feel a difference between a tenth of a wheel spin difference, but would notice a speed difference for a half of a wheel spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;#conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surly for the climbs&lt;/strong&gt;
It is a heavier frame, but with the lowest overall gear ratio of 1.13, I would assume the Surly will be a better climber. Its mountain bike drive train backs this up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemond for the speed&lt;/strong&gt;
With the rare exception of a continuous straight-hill descent with no stops or turns, the Lemond will be able to push out more rotational distance in the highest gear with a ratio of 4.5. The Surly is respectable at 4.36 rear-revolutions per crank turn. The reality is that most cyclists need to incrementally build up to such a high gear ratio. The Lemond has smaller increments on the highest gears, which means a more build-up of super-high speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overlap is subjective&lt;/strong&gt;
There are sweet spots on both bikes where the ratio is close, but unfortunately they are only within our margin of matching on the smallest two rear cogs. This means too much crossover in one scenario, and in the other it means I&amp;rsquo;m sustaining a speed of about 40+ mph at 94 rpm. No thanks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat road&lt;/strong&gt;
Since the bulk of this type of training and the century ride itself is largely on flat terrain, I will want to stick to the smaller front cog. This means that 2.25&amp;mdash;2.29 gear ratio will probably work for me at 93 rpm. That&amp;rsquo;s the fifth cog from highest on the Lemond, and the sixth cog from the highest on the Surly. Hmn, I might be better off just getting a cadence and speed monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other&#34;&gt;#other&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my blog, this is my first post in recent times and on a topic that has been in my headspace for some time. I&amp;rsquo;ll be covering all kinds of topics, largely as a journal as I explore going from a more traditional design to what John Maeda is calling &lt;a href=&#34;https://venturebeat.com/2016/03/14/kpcbs-john-maeda-3-types-of-design-every-company-needs-to-know/&#34;&gt;computational design&lt;/a&gt;. Some posts will be for fun, some with a product cap on, some with a design cap…good times.&lt;/p&gt;
