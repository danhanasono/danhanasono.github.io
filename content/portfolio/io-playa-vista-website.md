			<h2>Project Overview</h2>
			<p>The perfect storm involving the shrinking of <a href="http://myspace.com">MySpace</a>, a draw tenant, and the collapse of the real estate market in Southern California in 2009, lead to the disasterous opening of Latitude 34 Playa Vista. Without a key tenant, the two-building office complex, with design details honoring Howard Hughes aeronautical days, lay empty and dormant from opening through 2014, when it was purchased, redesigned, and rebranded for a younger agile tech workforce.</p>
			<p>The trifecta of <a href="http://www.clarionpartners.com/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Clarion Partners</a>, <a href="http://lpcwest.com" target="_blank">Lincoln Property Company</a>, and <a href="http://larealtypartners.com" target="_blank">L.A. Realty Partners</a>, along with re-invisioning architecture from <a href="http://gensler.com" target="_blank">Gensler</a> all culminated in a precedence whereby a 4-year-old failing property could be re-worked to fit current and future working culture.</p>
			<p>We were brought in to bring new energy to the project and communicate a clear new ownership direction for the broker and surrounding community.</p>

		  	<div class="expander-content">
			    <h4>Design Inspiration</h4>
			    <p>Working as a humble three-person team, and with rumors that Google was going to purchase a twelve-acre parcel adjacent to the project, we focused efforts on creating a website experience closer to a larger start-up tech company. The project would come together quickly, Clarion worked feverishly on a press embargo with L.A. Times announcing new leasing efforts in the area.</p>

			    <figcaption>An early draft of a visual sitemap and responsive wireframe. This project was quick and with a whole new client, best to be clear and concise.</figcaption>
			    <p>Creative copy-writing from Penny Benda (i|o defined multi-laterally as inspiration &amp; options, impressive &amp; open, input &amp; output, interactive &amp; optimized, ideas &amp; optimism, indoor &amp; outdoor) gave Looking a platform to create branding that was more fluid. From this came a website concept that could still be traditional with multiple pages, but also fluid with smooth-scrolling sections, redundant navigation to increase browsing-level awareness as was famous by start-ups, and quick interactive maps.</p>
			    <h4>Interviews &amp; Insights</h4>
			    <p>In interviews with the core team, Playa Vista was a relative unknown outside of Silicon Beach natives. A big marketing need was to separate the project from previous owners to the public while educating the brokerage community outside of Los Angeles of the potentials of Playa Vista.</p>

			<div class="expander-content">
				<h4>East Building or West Building</h4>
				<p>From user testing on the Latitude 34 website, a big confusion was to quickly orient the user to which building was which. With two rectangular buildings of similar footprint, and a differentiator of east vs. west, we devised a simple way to explain leasing availabilities.</p>

				  	</div>
			  	</div>
			  	<p>As the video shows above, we suggested a simple isometric sketch from the architects. Dull in detail, it served as a model. We drew and activated svg layers per floor and building, with javascript loading both a respective floor drawing as well as shifting a simple campus plan view upon click. Reports were that this eleviated confusion from 2D interactive site plans.</p>
				<h4>Amenities</h4>
				<p>Addressing the concern of if Playa Vista was suitable to move to. We did comprehensive research on retail, banking, hotel, dining, and gym/recreation amenities in the area. A custom map was created both for the regional amenities, as well as a neighborhood level map. The decision to use simple css-transition hovers to inform the user would keep 200+ point maps lightweight in feel and load time.</p>
				<p>When served on a smartphone, each pin is a list item that is sorted alphabetically by amenity type in an accordion with external link to the respective establishment. I give Clay all credit for thinking of this, but at the time it was brilliant. We used the phone's hardware (Google Map/Apple Maps) to serve up the nearest coffee spot. Here is a sample below of this section.</p>

			<div class="expander-content">
			    <p>The i|o at Playa Vista website was launched upon a press embargo with a feature story in the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-property-report-playa-20141218-story.html" target="_blank">L.A. Times</a> by Roger Vincent regarding the expansion of creative office space in Playa Vista. I remember, I was sweating bullets 5:00 a.m. that morning.</p>
			    <p>Two tenants were signed before launch, a testiment to the leasing team's brilliance. However, I would like to think the usability of the website helped snag the third major tenant, <a href="https://www.honest.com" target="_blank">The Honest Company</a>.</p>
			    <p>Most iteration on the site was design-based. We altered colors, redrew maps, and shot for honest clarity. Kudos to Clarion Partners.</p>

			    <p>Further marketing included an email campaign. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/937694/?pathWildcard=937694" target="_blank">Chernin Group</a> and <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/" target="_blank">Samsung</a> would sign leases along with original tenants <a href="https://www.fullscreen.com">Fullscreen</a> and <a href="https://www.groupm.com" target="_blank">GroupM</a>. With tenants like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/space/los-angeles.html" target="_blank">YouTube Space LA</a> just down the street, the east site of Playa Vista is now a media empire in Silicon Beach.</p>
