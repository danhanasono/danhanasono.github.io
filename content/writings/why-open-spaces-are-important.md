As part of a writing series for my favorite ongoing outdoor block party ever, [CicLAvia][cic-link], I wanted to share some thoughts on why it is that [open spaces][open-space] are important for cities from my perspective.

## #legoland2miniland2RL
A recent visit to [LEGOLAND][legoland] for spring break this past week was a blast. Thanks to some free tickets from a friend (thanks friend!), we spent some quality time together at our first amusement park visit as a family.

It took no more than a crowded park and some afternoon sun for my wife and I to notice that the kids were just a tad irritable. The kids were wonderful in general, but we could tell they needed a change of scenery from long lines, distant tantrums, all the freaking soda everywhere, etc. They were fed, dipes were clean, kids were well-rested, so we were left scratching our heads a little. It happened both days, and the hypothesis we came up with was that both kids were simply a little overstimulated.

Enter [Miniland][miniland-link], an area about 1/12th of the park with built-out miniature city dioramas of Las Vegas, California, New York City, and Washington D.C. at what I found cited as [1:20 scale][legoland-scale]. There were still many people here, but unlike the rest of the park which was covered in large amusement rides and lego themed buildings, Miniland was an open park.

In the open, kids were like a wilting plant to water. They calmed way down, or energized up, got very focused studying details and movement, and both kids were mesmerized in what I would call a self-storytelling state. There were other places in the park with lego statues, buildings, and movement, but they were surrounded by buildings or rides. Miniland was the one setion where the lower height of the models meant more open sky, more space, and the kids responded well to it.

Translating this to real life, we could see in a controlled experience that having room to move freely, to explore freely, really changed the mindset for both kids. We visited the section both days to recharge and push on for the afternoon. Fresh off the trip, I have noticed in general how going out into the open helps both kids behaviorally, and I can only extrapolate that this is true for most denizens of a city.

In true product fashion, and admitting that I am no urban planner, I wanted to interview some other people for their thoughts and ideas on open space. I asked a landscape designer what her thoughts were. 

> "Open spaces in metropolitan cities mean there is light. There is room to observe and feel light on the physical body. Without open spaces, light is controlled out of experience into indoor building. Light is essential."

What a cool answer, I sent out email surveys and will post additional answers here. I thought I'd share my own two cents below.

My answer for why open spaces are so important to cities is conservative in nature. Open spaces, specifically parks and plazas in a metropolitan area are important as they represent the only living/organic relics that reflect lifestyle and civilization of the area over time.

Los Angeles State Historic Park just reopened last week, after 65 public hearings and over three years of construction. The clip above was made by [Thomas Carroll][tom-explores] and shows the park right before it was renovated. 

Renovated? Yes, the renovation itself explains why I think open spaces are so important to cities. Renovated Los Angeles State Historic Park has a pedestrian bridge, an irrigation system for reclaimed water, an orange grove, California Poppies, trees, and you guessed it…open space. 

In 50 years the area may be completely different, but for now it is a playable, enjoyable space that reflects how Los Angelians like and use a public space. It's a beautiful living histograph of society. In 100 years maybe the park will be all floating seats with usb dongles and xxl iced coffee cup holders, but that will be then.

## #keepitopen
Squares in Paris, green lots in Vancouver, Central Park in NYC, the Pacific Ocean in West L.A., they are all open spaces, and having spent time in each, mind playgrounds for me. I find myself rejuvinated in them, just like my kids at Miniland. Perhaps it is that I think food and drink taste better in big open spaces, maybe it is the people watching (#keepitweird right?), but I think in summary it is the articulation of space that gives us an awareness of space and makes us all feel a little more human.

Now let's put everything to sleep and go find a sunny spot and a sarong and go catnap outside.

## #hattip
I've been trying to enjoy the outdoors more this year. One small group of dedicated outdoor enthusiasts deserve a little hat tip. Go on instagram and search for #ballonacreekcampcoffee or #larivercampcoffee. Book your morning alarm on an upcoming Wednesday, and meet us to drink coffee outside together. It is dope, and something I hope becomes a past time as timeless as the fishermen fishing on the jetty next to us.
